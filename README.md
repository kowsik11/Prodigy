# 🎓 Deep Learning Projects – Internship Portfolio

Welcome to my internship project repository! This folder contains 4 hands-on tasks completed as part of my Deep Learning internship, covering foundational to advanced applications using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## 📁 Tasks Overview

### ✅ Task 1 – Image Classification using CNN
Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from a standard dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10 or MNIST). Focused on building, training, and evaluating the model using TensorFlow/Keras.

### ✅ Task 2 – Cat vs Dog Classifier
Developed a binary image classifier to distinguish between cat and dog images using transfer learning with a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16 or MobileNet).

### ✅ Task 3 – Face Mask Detection
Built a real-time face mask detection system using OpenCV and a CNN model trained to identify whether a person is wearing a mask.
