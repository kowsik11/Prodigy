## 📚 Overview

This repository contains two key tasks using OpenAI's GPT-2 model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library:

- **Task 1**: Generate text using the **pretrained GPT-2 model**.
- **Task 2**: Fine-tune GPT-2 on a **custom dataset** to produce more domain-specific or tailored output.

## 📌 Task 1: Text Generation Using Pretrained GPT-2

This task demonstrates how to use Hugging Face's GPT-2 model for **text generation** based on a user-provided prompt.

### 🔧 Requirements

```bash
pip install transformers torch

📌 Sample Output
Prompt:
India will become the superpower if

Generated Text (Example):

India will become the superpower if it continues to invest in education, infrastructure, and technological innovation across industries. 
The path forward includes strategic diplomacy and a unified national vision...
